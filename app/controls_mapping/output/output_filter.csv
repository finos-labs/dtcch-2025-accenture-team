CSTP,Third Party Security Risk Management ,CSTP.1,Third Party Security Due Diligence,DORA,MANAGING OF ICT THIRD-PARTY RISK,Key contractual provisions,"Article 30, 2(i)","DORA_Article 30, 02(i)",The contractual arrangements on the use of ICT services shall include at least the following elements: (i) the conditions for the participation of ICT third-party service providers in the financial entities' ICT security awareness programmes and digital operational resilience training in accordance with Article 13(6).,Partial Match,"While both objectives address third-party management and contractual requirements, the matched control is narrower in scope, focusing specifically on ICT security awareness and training requirements. The original control objective is broader, encompassing comprehensive security posture assessment, risk documentation, and overall security requirements in contracts. The matched control lacks explicit mention of pre-onboarding assessment and general security risk evaluation.","This relates to DORA Articles 28 (Contractual Arrangements), 13(6) (ICT Security Awareness), and 26 (Pre-contractual Assessment). The matched control only addresses Article 28(i) and 13(6), while missing key requirements from Article 26 regarding pre-contractual due diligence and risk assessment. DORA requires a more comprehensive approach to third-party risk management than what's reflected in the matched control.","To achieve full DORA compliance, the control should be expanded to include:    1. Explicit pre-onboarding security assessment requirements    2. Documentation of risk assessment methodology    3. Comprehensive security requirements beyond just awareness and training    4. Risk-based approach to contract requirements    5. Continuous monitoring provisions    6. Integration with overall ICT risk management framework"

The original control objective has a broader scope, including initial security posture assessment and documentation before onboarding, which isn't explicitly covered in the matched control. The matched control emphasizes business contingency plans and ongoing security measures but doesn't specifically address the pre-onboarding assessment phase.","- DORA Article 28(3)(c) addresses contractual arrangements for ICT third-party service providers
- DORA Article 26 requires comprehensive risk assessment of ICT third-party providers
- DORA Articles 5(2) and 6(1) mandate risk assessment and management frameworks
- Missing explicit reference to initial security posture assessment documentation as required by DORA Article 26","To achieve full DORA compliance:
1. Expand the control to explicitly include pre-contractual security assessment documentation
2. Include specific reference to risk assessment methodology aligned with DORA requirements
3. Add provisions for continuous monitoring and periodic reassessment of third-party security posture

The original control focuses primarily on security posture assessment and contractual requirements, while DORA's requirements extend to: 1) Critical/important function classification, 2) Supervisory conditions, 3) ICT concentration risk, 4) Comprehensive due diligence, and 5) Conflict of interest assessment. The original control lacks explicit consideration of these broader risk categories.",Key DORA requirements not fully addressed in original control:    - Article 28(9): Assessment of critical or important functions    - Article 29: ICT concentration risk evaluation    - Article 30(2): Comprehensive due diligence requirements    - Article 28(1): Supervisory conditions compliance    The original control needs expansion to fully align with DORA Articles 28-30 regarding ICT third-party risk management.,"To achieve full DORA compliance, the original control should be enhanced to:    1. Include explicit assessment of function criticality    2. Add concentration risk evaluation    3. Expand due diligence requirements beyond security    4. Include conflict of interest assessment    5. Reference supervisory conditions    6. Implement formal documentation requirements for all assessment aspects    7. Establish periodic review mechanisms for ongoing compliance"
